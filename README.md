By  keeping something secret, people can protect their their reputation and  their relationships with close others. Yet, when people choose to keep  secrets, they run the risk of feeling isolated from other people, which  can lead to negative well-being outcomes.

On the one hand, keeping a secret could be isolating, hurting negative  well-being. On the other hand, revealing a shameful secret could lead to social rejection. If people communicate the learned negative  information to other people, oneâ€™s reputation could be tarnished.

Talking to another person about your secret can be very helpful, but only if  the secret is revealed to the right person. Revealing a secret to the  wrong person can do more harm than good, and so it is crucial to reveal a secret to the right person. Someone who will be non-judgemental, who can provide trustworthy advice, and who will be discreet makes for an ideal confidant. Such a person would not hold your secret against you, could  help you think about how to move forward, and will keep your secret for  you. 

If you are unable to reveal your secret  (such as for reasons of confidentiality), or do not feel you can  identify someone with those qualities to reveal a secret to, you can  post your secret here. Your identity will be kept anonymous here, and  you will feel better after getting it off your chest.
